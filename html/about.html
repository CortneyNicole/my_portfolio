        <h3>But seriously, let me tell you about myself.</h3>
            
            <br/>
<p>Hi there. My name is Cortney. If you asked me about myself last year, I would have told you that I was a hair stylist at a high-end salon. A lot has changed since then.</p>

<p>Back in September of 2016 I started on my journey to becoming a full-stack developer. After being exposed to the tech world through my fianc√©e I became obsessed with figuring out to implement her designs. In working closely with a Senior Designer from the start, I have become very knowledgable at Front-End.</p>

<p>After several months of self-learning I quit my job to pursue development full-time. Since June of 2017 I have been a student at Dev Bootcamp learning full-stack development. I will graduate in October 2017.</p>
